# Codeclan Week 03 Day 05

## Homework Assignment
### Codeclan Cinema

You've been tasked with building a bookings system for a cinema.
This bookings program will be built in Ruby using a Postgres database.
This cinema should have films, tickets and customers - later screenings.
Films, Tickets & Customers should have basic CRUD functionality
Functions should be added as per MVP and extension spec in brief.md


## Notes

* Was ill during this one so limped through it with half a brain.
* Decide whether or not to pass strings/objects to functions
* A lot of time wasted on forgetting the format which data is returned from postgres AN ARRAY OF STRINGS!
* Find/replace can be handy but you'll spend more time tweaking and learn less than just typing it in the first place.
* Is it better to use console to create data or load with SQL?
